# Bin-Packing--Knapsack-problem-
In the simple knapsack problem, there is a single container (a knapsack). The items have values as well as sizes, and the goal is to pack a subset of the items that has maximum total value.

For the special case in which value is equal to size, the goal is to maximize the total size of the packed items.
